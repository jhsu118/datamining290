#### 8 Questions
Data types available to me: integers, character strings
694,193 records organized into different types of categories
One record that interests me is that there are 137,800 persons naturalized into the U.S. in 2011 whose occupation is unknown. This is interesting to me because I always thought that employment and employment status were important in determining whether citizenship was granted.
Three questions I could answer using my data:
- How old are most people when they receive U.S. citizenship?
- What occupations do most naturalized citizens hold?
- How much do naturalized citizens contribute to the U.S. economy?
